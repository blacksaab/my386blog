<!-- Do an EDA of a dataset (preferably the data you collected for the last project) and write a blog post about the highlights of your EDA.   

You should do a preliminary EDA of a dataset (preferably the data you scraped from the previous mini-project).  You should report the highlights of your EDA in a blog post.  Please update the date of your blog post to a "November" day.

Your blog post should have the following:

    An informative title and brief description
    An introduction.  Briefly introduce your project.  Don't repeat verbatim the intro from your previous post, but don't just refer to the previous post without any intro.  You can refer to the previous post, but still keep the current post self contained.
    5ish - 10ish figures and tables that give the reader a feel for your data with a few sentences of interpretation or explanation 
    A conclusion with your main findings and a hint of the story of the data

Also, you should update the GitHub repository that contains the work for this project.  If you are using new data, then create a new repository with the relevant files.  Include a link to your GitHub repo in your blog post.  -->

## The Data 

The data I collected comes from the NOAA. It includes observations from 71 weather stations around Utah County, Utah from January 1, 1990 through March 30, 2023. As an avid skiier, my hope for this data is to find some way of predicting how "good" a ski season will be based on the conditions of the previous summer. This post will only cover some preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset. 

## Exploratoring the Data 

### About the Data

There are 5 core variables that came with the data: 
1. PRCP = Precipitation (inches)
2. SNOW = Snowfall (inches)
3. SNWD = Snow depth (inches)
4. TMAX = Maximum temperature (Fahrenheit)
5. TMIN = Minimum temperature (Fahrenheit)

Each variable is a daily summary meaning that `SNOW` represents the total snowfall recorded on a given day. 

The weather stations are located throughout Utah County. Although they are not randomly placed; I used the average value amongst all weather stations (not counting missing values) realizing that this does not represent the true average weather across Utah County.

### Big Trends

From this scatterplot of daily maximum temperatures, we see a very pleasing seasonal swing in the daily high temperature.

This graph is similar to the one above, only the temperatures collected for each day at all stations are averaged to produce a line plot.

In this plot we see the distributions for maximum temperatures for each month. July is typically the hottest month and January is typically the coldest. Interestingly, the only months where temperatures never fell below freezing were July and August.

This plot also plots the distribution of maximum daily temperatures, but by year instead of month. If there were some large pattern in maximum daily temperatures that correlated with time, we would expect to see it here. With global warming as a reality, and the state being in a record drought (until this winter that is), I expected to see a clear positive shift in maximum daily temperatures. However, I cannot see that this is the case from this plot.
