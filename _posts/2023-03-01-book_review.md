This brief narrative from Broussard dissects the plethora of issues rampant in the contemporary tech industry. From massive flaws in how the Philidelphia public school system handles textbooks, to dangerous self-driving cars, to reckless technochauvinists who place profits above all else. 

Broussard is excellent at bringing the issues to life through stories - in true journalistic fashion. This book is full of her personal experiences she had investigating these issues. She personally investigated the textbook problems in Philidelphia public schools, rode in self-driving cars, and spent time as a "busprenour" developing an app to calculate the optimal pizza order for any party. Broussard's excellent use of narrative makes her arguments poignantly clear, impossible to misunderstand, and difficult to disagree with. 

Although the catchphrase on the front of the book says, "How Computers Misunderstand the World" it would have been more accurate if it read, "How Humans Misunderstand Computers and Each Other". The main takeaway from her book is not that computers are completely inadequate at "thinking" (which they completely are) but rather that people are completely inadequate at understanding the limitations of their own technology. As someone who is studying computer science, statistics, and machine learning, it was already obvious to me that people have been heralding Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence as a magic solution to almost any issue, with very little thought to the possible ramifications or or limitations of the technology. 

Overall, I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in the ethical dillemas surrounding artificial intelligence. Broussard gives an enlightening peek into the inner workings and shortcomings of the tech industry. However, as someone with knowledge of computers, math, and statistics, I found some of her lower-level explanations of how computers function to be a bit boring. Overall, I would rate this book 4 out of 5 stars.
