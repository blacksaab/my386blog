`ggplot` has some amazing tools for plotting and analyzing data. And plotting functions can be just as easy... if you know how.

## Using `geom_func()` to Plot R Functions
The easiest way to plot functions with ggplot is by using `geom_function()`. Unlike other geoms, `geom_function()` does not need to take an aesthetic argument. That is, `mapping = NULL` (well, most of the time). Instead, `geom_function()` takes two other arguments: `fun` and `args`. `fun` is short for *function*, and it takes any function which takes a numeric as its first argument. For example, `dnorm`, `pnorm`, or even `sqrt`. For example,

    ggplot() +
        geom_function(
            fun = dnorm
        )

Functions don't always graph nicely on the first go. We can make it a little nicer by adding some pizazz...

## How to Type Special Math Symbols in Plot Labels
Have you ever wanter to add math symbols like $\mu$ or $\sigma$ into your graph labels? In order to do this, you can assign either `quote()` or `expression()` to the axis label(s), title, subtitle, etc. For example:

    ggplot() +
        geom_function(
            fun = dnorm,
            args = c(mean = 5, sd = 10),
            color = "cadetblue"
        ) +
        geom_vline(
            xintercept = 5,
            color = "lightcoral",
            linetype = "dashed"
        ) +
        xlim(-25, 35) +
        labs(
            title = "Normal Distribution",
            subtitle = quote(~mu == 5 ~sigma^2 == 100),
            x = "x",
            y = quote(~phi[~mu ~sigma](x))
        )

## How to Plot Custom Math Function with `geom_func()`
You can also plot whatever math functions you would like. In order to do this, you must use special notation. In order to do this, you must use R's formula notation for the value of the `fun` input:

    ggplot() +
        geom_function(
            fun = ~ .x^2
        )

You can make functions as complicated as you wish. Notice how I make use of [R's many color options](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) to spice up my plots:

    ggplot() +
        geom_function(
            fun = ~ .x^5 + 2*(.x)^4 + .x^3 + 4*(.x)^2 + .x,
            color = "lemonchiffon3"
        ) +
        labs(
            title = "Graphing complex Functions with ggplot",
            x = "X",
            y = quote(x^5 + 2*x^4 + x^3 + 4*x^2 + sqrt(x))
        ) +
        xlim(-3, 2)

<!--Insert fourth graph here-->

## Using Data to Plot Functions

Another way to plot functions is by using data. The idea is that you generate many y values along a range of x values and then connect the dots using `geom_smooth`. The benefit of this method is that you don't necessarily need a formula for the line. You just need a bunch of points.

    x = seq(from = 0, to = 10, length.out = 1000)

    y = x^2

    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        geom_smooth(color = "lightgoldenrodyellow", se=FALSE) +
        labs(
            title = "Plotting with vectors",
            x = "x",
            y = quote(x^2)
        )

With these tools you should be able to plot nearly any function using `ggplot`!
